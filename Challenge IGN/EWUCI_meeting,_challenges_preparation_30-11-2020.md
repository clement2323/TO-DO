#réunion e anglais Sur le climat IGN

# idée commencer avec les carreaux
# so far we have only socio economic variables on this grid, 
# the idea is to add indicator (other) to this grid datas, like climate variable
# there is a lot of information available but it's difficult to compute, idea of the challenge : integrate results from climate and meteo data into existing grid at european levl (1km)(or national level 200 m)
# interesting to cross french grid and integrate other information from files. 

# depending between agencies ? 

# Rina de geostat 4 intervient
# VL we want to integrate from different domain, not same words than Rina but underlying questions are the same. At the end we want one table with integrate information

# lot of question in  line regarding the statisticl community
# add one layer to highlight some specific point (legal, technical etc..)

#idea of the challenge : add some methodology on how to harmonising existing indicator !
